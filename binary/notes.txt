@method setCookies

You can set cookies using a "main document URL", which I suspect has something
to do with which cookies are stored on a given page in the file.

Or maybe all the cookies for a given web page are on a cookie page?

The Foundation library contains an undefined _crc32 linkage point, suggesting
maybe it uses that for a checksum internally.
